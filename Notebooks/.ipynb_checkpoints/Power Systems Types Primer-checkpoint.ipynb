    "# Economic Dispatch modular modeling primer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to show a power system modeling framework that exploits the capabilities of Julia to improve performance and allow modelers to develop modular system to analyze problems with different complexities. The aim is to replicate the practices of other communities such as Climate Change Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) that allow the integration of expertise from different fields into large scale optimization problems. An example of these efforts is the [Mimi modeling framework](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Mimi.jl). \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is divided in two main portions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Type definitions for power system components. \n",
    "- Model definitions and modifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first version of the modeling platform is based on [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) model modification.  Currently JuMP has some difficulties with model modification, however, in [in this post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/mathoptinterface-and-upcoming-breaking-changes-in-jump-0-19/4874) the developers have expressed the interest in expanding the capabilities in JuMP to make the modifications easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the current version of the code should be interpreted as a proof of concept considering that my expertise is power systems and not software engineering. In the future, the code can be improved with better practices. The code has been developed based on the [Economic Distpatch (ED) Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_dispatch).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example system for this notebook is the [Small Test Systems for Power System Economic Studies](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589973), modified to include 2 PV-Plants and time series of load and renewable energy. The system data can also be accessed in [Matpower format](http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/docs/ref/matpower5.0/case5.html). "

    "## Type definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "The objecitve is to exploit Julia's integration of dynamic types with the function dispatch. As explained in Julia's documentation: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Juliaâ€™s type system is dynamic, but gains some of the advantages of static type systems by making it possible to indicate that certain values are of specific types. This can be of great assistance in generating efficient code, but even more significantly, it allows method dispatch on the types of function arguments to be deeply integrated with the language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the types are defined for MEMF is by using immutable types. There are two kinds of composite types (in 0.6) ``struct`` (an immutable type, old name was ``immutable``) and ``mutable struct`` (a mutable type, old name was ``type``). ``mutable struct``s are always allocated on the heap. ``struct``s will be allocated on the stack under certain conditions. (One case where they won't be allocated on the stack right now is if they have a field that is a ``mutable struct``). If a ``struct`` only has e.g. bitstype fields, the ``struct`` should always end up on the stack, and for example an array of such a ``struct`` should have a really nice dense memory layout with no boxing or anything like that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on Julia types, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.6/manual/types/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power Systems types \n",
    "\n",
    "Each component type is a composite type with fields that completely describe its characteristics. For example, the node type is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia \n",
    "\n",
    "struct bus\n",
    "    Number::Int\n",
    "    Name::String\n",
    "    BusType::String # [PV, PQ, SF]\n",
    "    Voltage::Float64 # [pu]\n",
    "    MaxVoltage::Float64 # [pu]\n",
    "    MinVoltage::Float64 # [pu]\n",
    "    Angle::Float64 # [degrees]\n",
    "    BaseVoltage::Float64 # [kV]\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the information from some components might be needed to describe others; such is the case of the branches which are defined in the most basic case as the impedance between nodes. Hence, the type branch is defined in terms of a tuple of buses as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Julia \n",
    "struct branch\n",
    "    number::Int\n",
    "    status::Bool\n",
    "    branch_type::String #[Line, Transf, 3W-Transf]\n",
    "    ConnectionPoints::Tuple{bus,bus}    \n",
    "    R::Float64 #[pu]\n",
    "    X::Float64 #[pu]\n",
    "    B::Float64 #[pu]\n",
    "    MaxCapacity_forward::Float64  #[MVA]\n",
    "    MaxCapacity_backward::Float64 #[MVA]\n",
    "    BaseVoltage::Float64 #[kV]\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where the field ```ConnectionPoints``` only accepts elements of the type ```bus``` enforcing consistency between the information. In a later version of this type, it will be possible to define constructors inside of the type definitions to maintain data consistency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of this system is the use of abstract types to create collections of type that share the same data structures. For example, thermal generation, which could be coal, gas or oil. For the purposes of power systems operation all of them are characterized by similar parameters: maximum and minimum power, ramping limits and minimum up and down times; however, for planning purposes the type of fuel and installation cost are the relevant pieces of information. Moreover, if the intent is to characterize the dynamics then each generator must have a different machine dynamics model associated with it and a different prime mover dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "As of this version, the generator model is comprised of two structures. One that contains the technical information and a second one that contains the economic information. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",

    "    TechnicalParameters::Nullable{generator_tech} \n",
    "    EconomicParameters::Nullable{generator_econ} \n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar type definition is used for renewable power, storage systems and loads. The main difference in the structures of load and renewable power is the inclusion of a field for time series information of the type ```TimeArray```. This is included considering that in modern power systems analysis for the integration of renewables accounting for the time component of load and generation is paramount.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of the software is composed of 5 main collections of structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```basic_types.jl```: Contains the most basic power system components and parameters buses, branches and the structure of a network. \n",
