# Julia Coding Style Guide for PowerSystems.jl

## Goals

* Define a straightforward set of rules that lead to consistent, readable
  code.
* Developers focus on producing high quality code, not how to format it.

## Base

* Read the official
[Julia style guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/index.html) as reference.
* Read [Julia contribution guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#general-formatting-guidelines-for-julia-code-contributions), notably its line length limit.
* Read [Julia guidelines for docstrings](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/index.html).
* Read [JuMP coding standards](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/dev/style). In particular, note its policies on
  * [whitespace](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/dev/style/#Whitespace-1)
  * [return statements](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/dev/style/#Return-statements-1)
  * [variable names](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/dev/style/#Use-of-underscores-within-names-1).
* Read [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020).
* Consider using a plugin that configures your text editor to use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) settings.

## Code Organization

* Import standard modules, then 3rd-party modules, then yours. Include a blank
  line between each group.

<!-- ### Modules:  TODO -->

## Comments

* Use comments to describe non-obvious or non-trivial aspects of code.
  Describe why something was done but not how. The "how" should be apparent from
  the code itself.
* Use complete sentences and proper grammar.
* Include a space in between the "#" and the first word of the comment.
* Use these tags in comments to describe known work:
  * `TODO`:  tasks that need to be done
  * `FIXME`:  code that needs refactoring
  * `BUG`:  known bug that exists. Should include a bug ID and tracking system.
  * `PERF`:  known performance limitation that needs improvement

## Constructors

* Per guidance from Julia documentation, use inner constructors to enforce
  restrictions on parameters or to allow construction of self-referential
  objects.
  Use outer constructors to provide default values or to perform customization.
* Document the reason why the outer constructor is different.
* Note that the compiler will provide a default constructor with all struct
members if no inner constructor is defined.
* When creating a constructor use `function Foo()` instead of `Foo() = ...`.
  * One exception is the case where one file has all single-line functions.

## Exceptions

* Use exceptions for unexpected errors and not for normal error handling.
  * Detection of an unsupported data format from a user should likely throw
  an exception and terminate the application.
  * Do not use try/catch to handle retrieving a potentially-missing key from a
  dictionary.
* Use @assert statements to guard against programming errors. Do not use them
  after detecting bad user input. Note that they may be compiled out in release
  builds.

## Globals

* Global constants should be written in upper case and be declared `const`.
    - `const UPPER_CASE_VARIABLE = Ï€ / 2`
* If global variables are needed, prefix them with "g_".
* Don't use [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29). Instead, define `const GLOBALS` or `Enums` (Julia @enum).

## One-line Conditionals

Julia code base uses this idiom frequently: `<cond> && <statement>`.

See [Example](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/manual/control-flow/#Short-Circuit-Evaluation-1):

```julia
function fact(n::Int)
   n >= 0 || error("n must be non-negative")
   n == 0 && return 1
   n * fact(n-1)
end
```

This is acceptable for simple code as in this example. However, in general,
prefer to write out an entire if statement.

Ternary operators provide a way to write clean, concise code.  Use good
judgement.

Good:

```julia
y = x > 0 ? x : -x
```

There are many examples in our codebase that use the form ```<cond> ?
<statement> : <statement>```.  These can be expressed much more clearly in an
if/else statement.

## Unit Tests

All code should be tested.

## Whitespace

* If many function arguments cause the line length to be exceeded, put one
argument per line. In some cases it may make sense to pair some variables on
the same line.

```julia
function foo(var1::String,
             var2::String,
             var3::String,
             var4::String,
             var5::String,
             var6::String)
```

* Do not surround equal signs with spaces when passing keyword args to a
function or defining default values in function declarations.
* Do not right-align equal signs when assigning groups of variables. It causes
  unnecessary changes whenever someone adds a new variable with a longer name.

Bad:

```julia
x   = 1
foo = 2
```

Good:

```julia
x = 1
foo = 2
```

* Define abstract types on one line. Given the lack of IDE support for Julia,
  this makes it easier to find type definitions.

Bad:

```julia
abstract type
    Foo
end
```

Good:

```julia
abstract type Foo end

## Exports

`export` should be used to make it easy for the user to use a symbol from the REPL,
an interactive interface or a program.

You may _need_ to use `export` when extending functionality of other packages
that have also exported the same symbol.

All symbols that have `export` **must** have proper docstrings.
