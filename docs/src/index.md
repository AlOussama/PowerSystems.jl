`PowerSystems.jl` is a [`Julia`](http://www.julialang.org) package Power Systems Modeling that provides a rigorous data model using Julia structures to enable power systems modeling.

`PowerSystems.jl` provides tools to prepares and processes data useful for electric energy systems modelling.

`PowerSystems.jl` features include:
    - A

`PowerSystems.jl` documentation and code are organized according to the needs of different users depending on their skillset and requirements. In broad terms there are three categories:

- Modeler: A user that want to use `PowerSystems.jl` to develop a new data set for a particular analysis or experiment.

- Model Deverloper: A user that wants to develop custom device and components and structs and exploit `PowerSystems.jl` features to produce custom data sets.

- Advance Developers: A user that want to add new core functionalities or fix bugs in the core capabilties of `PowerSystems.jl`. This user should also check
[`InfrastructureSystems.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP/InfrastructureSystems.jl).

`PowerSystems.jl` in an active project under development, and we welcome your feedback, suggestions, and bug reports.

Extended examples of use can be found in [SIIP-Examples PowerSystems](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP/SIIPExamples.jl/tree/master/notebook/PowerSystems_examples)
